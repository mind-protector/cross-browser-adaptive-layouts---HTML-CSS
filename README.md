All layouts were found freely available on the Internet. Less was compiled in css thanks to the LessAutoCompile plugin in the Brackets code editor. Scss was compiled by npm (node.js). All layouts were well adapted to modern versions of major browsers and to their mobile versions.

- IE 11
 
- Edge 10
 
- Chrome 77
